Let's see how much better our Q-learning solution is when compared to the agent making just random moves.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Average number of penalties per episode: The smaller the number, the better the performance of our agent. Ideally, we would like this metric to be zero or very close to zero.\n",
    "* Average number of timesteps per trip: We want a small number of timesteps per episode as well since we want our agent to take minimum steps(i.e. the shortest path) to reach the destination.\n",
    "* Average rewards per move: The larger the reward means the agent is doing the right thing. That's why deciding rewards is a crucial part of Reinforcement Learning. In our case, as both timesteps and penalties are negatively rewarded, a higher average reward would mean that the agent reaches the destination as fast as possible with the least penalties\""
